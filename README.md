# PackY

PackY is a simple and intuitive software for creating batch file archives. A common use case is to archive the configuration files of installed software in separate containers but grouped together in a single folder. This projet is currently under development and this page will be updated later with more information.

## Installation


## Report issue

PackY is currently available in alpha version, which means you may encounter bugs during use. If this is the case, you can report the problem by creating a new issue on this github repository. Of course, you should first check that the problem has not already been reported by someone else.

## Roadmap

The following features will soon be available:

- Add a preview window when click on run.
- Add an option to check archive integrity.
- Add an option to pack only modified files since the last snapshot.
- Add icons on buttons.
- Add a way to run PackY in command line.
- Internationalization.

This software is intended to remain simple, so there are no plans to add many more features.
